# Chris Gramly · Clear Modern Mortgage — Engineering Notes

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript single-page site that wraps a single
`<Canvas>` (`@react-three/fiber`) with a cinematic scroll-bound 3D
experience. Below the cinematic hero are real, navigable mortgage
sections (about, purchase, refinance calculator, resources, contact form).

## Stack

- **Build**: Vite 6, TypeScript 5
- **UI**: React 18
- **3D**: `three` 0.171, `@react-three/fiber` 8, `@react-three/drei` 9, `@react-three/postprocessing` 2
- **Animation**: `gsap` 3 + `@gsap/react` + ScrollTrigger
- **Fonts**: Cormorant Garamond (display serif) + Inter (UI sans), Google Fonts
- **Deploy**: GitHub Pages via Actions, base path `/ChrisGramlyMortgage/`

## Single Canvas convention

There is exactly **one** `<Canvas>` in the whole app, mounted by
`CanvasRoot.tsx` and positioned `fixed; inset: 0; pointer-events: none`.
Each scene is a React component placed inside it (visible only while its
scroll range is active).

Why: every additional Canvas allocates a WebGL context, kills shared
state, and tanks mobile performance.

If you need a "different scene" you build a new component in
`components/canvas/scenes/` and reveal/hide it via the scroll context.

## Scroll context (`lib/scroll.ts`)

- A single ScrollTrigger covers `<main>`'s height. Its progress (0→1)
  is exposed via `useScroll()` (subscribe pattern, not React state — we
  do not want every frame to trigger a React render).
- Each scene reads progress in its `useFrame` and computes its own
  local 0→1 based on `pageBounds.ts`. Example: SceneSky owns the first
  100vh, so its local progress = clamp((globalY - 0) / vh, 0, 1).
- 2D copy overlays use GSAP timelines whose `progress()` is set from the
  same global scroll value — that way scroll-up reverses the animation.

## Animation rules

- **Bind to scroll, not to time** — every reveal/transition is driven by
  the scroll context. No `setTimeout`, no autoplaying intro that finishes
  on a clock.
- **All animations reversible** — scrolling up must undo everything that
  scrolling down did. No one-shot `.add()` to a timeline that doesn't
  reverse.
- Camera moves use cubic ease-in-out via small helpers in scenes (no
  GSAP for camera position — it's just a `useFrame` lerp).

## Palette

| Token            | Hex       | Use                                                |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `--paper`        | `#f6f0e4` | Warm cream background for light sections           |
| `--paper-sub`    | `#ece4d2` | Section dividers / subtle bands                    |
| `--ink`          | `#0a1224` | Body text on light                                 |
| `--ink-soft`     | `#2d3a52` | Secondary text                                     |
| `--brass`        | `#c8a047` | Primary gold accent — buttons, links, scene gold   |
| `--brass-deep`   | `#9a7830` | Hover / pressed                                    |
| `--sky-top`      | `#050816` | Scene 1 sky top                                    |
| `--sky-bottom`   | `#0d1530` | Scene 1 sky bottom                                 |
| `--ink-dark`     | `#f6f0e4` | Text on dark scenes (same as paper for cohesion)   |

**The cinematic scenes are dark. The rest of the site is warm and
light.** Don't smear charcoal everywhere — the previous attempt did
that and it felt oppressive.

## Performance budget

- 60fps on a 2021 iPhone (A14)
- Limit total triangles in any active scene to ~50k
- `dpr={[1, 1.75]}` on the Canvas (don't render at 3x on retina)
- Pause scenes when their scroll range is fully off-screen
- `<Bloom>` is the most expensive postprocess — keep `intensity` modest

## Don'ts

- No new `<Canvas>` instances
- No `useState` driven by `useFrame` (causes per-frame React render)
- No `setInterval` / `setTimeout` for scene animation
- No "Welcome!" / "Hello!" / exclamation copy
- No emojis
- No first-person flight / airplane / helicopter clichés
- No orbit controls unless the prompt explicitly asks for them
- No corporate stock photography

## Building & deploying

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server at 127.0.0.1:5173
npm run build    # Output to dist/
npm run preview  # Serve the build
```

GitHub Pages source must be set to **"GitHub Actions"** in repo settings.
The workflow `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds `/dist` and deploys.
